<p>You need to solve the murder by finding the right suspect, the right murder weapon, and the correct airport where the murder happened.</p>

<p><strong>To accuse someone of the murder:</strong></p>
<ol id="help_ol">
    <li>Click their picture from the suspects list.</li>
    <li>Select the murder weapon you think they used by <br>clicking it in the murder weapon list.</li>
</ol>

<p>You must make the correct accusation at the right airport to get the murderer jailed. The airport you are currently at will be used as the location for your accusation.</p>

<p>When you think you've got everything right, <br>press the <strong>Accuse</strong> button to make your accusation.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul id="help_ul">
    <li>Your fellow travelers will leave the airplane if you stay <br>too long at the same airport.</li>
    <li>Between accusations, you <strong>must</strong> fly to a new airport. <br>Flying costs 75 €.</li>
    <li>You can fly to a new airport by clicking <strong>Fly</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're running out of money, you can try to earn more by gambling. <br>Gambling costs 50 € per attempt, but you might win extra money.</p>
